      "summary": "<p><b>Fox NFL Sunday</b> is an American sports-talk television program on Fox that debuted on September 4, 1994, and serves as the pre-game show for the network's National Football League game telecasts under the <i>NFL on Fox</i> brand. An audio simulcast of the program airs on sister radio network Fox Sports Radio, which is distributed by Premiere Radio Networks. As of 2014, the program has won four Emmy Awards. <i>Fox NFL Sunday</i> debuted on September 4, 1994, when Fox inaugurated its NFL game broadcasts through the network's recently acquired broadcast rights to the National Football Conference; it was originally hosted by James Brown, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson (both Brown and Bradshaw had joined the network from CBS to help helm Fox's NFL coverage). The program was notable in being the first hour-long NFL pregame show on a broadcast television network; network pregame programs that existed beforehand, such as CBS' <i>The NFL Today</i> or NBC's <i>NFL Live!</i>, aired as 30-minute broadcasts. Fox's show also adopted a looser, more irreverent approach than its predecessors in order to also appeal to the network's younger-skewing audiences. During Johnson's initial season on <i>Fox NFL Sunday</i>, he would often join the show from his home in Florida. There was much speculation that Jimmy Johnson would return to coaching during the first year of the program's run. Prior to the end of the year, Johnson made an \"announcement,\" saying he was happy with his new career in broadcasting. But in 1996, he left the program to become head coach of the Miami Dolphins; Ronnie Lott was brought in to succeed him, and stayed with the program for two seasons.</p>",

Oxygen's hit true crime series, <i>Snapped</i>, profiles the fascinating cases of women accused of murder. Did they really do it? And, if they did, why? Whether the motivation was revenge against a cheating husband, the promise of a hefty insurance payoff, or putting an end to years of abuse, the reasons are as varied as the women themselves. From socialites to secretaries, female killers share one thing in common: at some point, they all snapped. <b>Snapped </b>is produced in conjunction with Jupiter Entertainment, the creators of <i>City Confidential</i> and <i>Dominick Dunne's Power</i>, <i>Privilege &amp; Justice</i>, and narrated by veteran news reporter Sharon Martin. Each episode of <i>Snapped</i> chronicles the life of a woman who has been charged with murder. These shocking but true stories turn common assumptions about crime and criminals upside down, and prove that even the most unlikely suspects can be capable of murder.</p>",

In addition to being a rigorous and unsparing examination of India's abuse and her own culpability, it explores how India and a chorus of other women are still grappling to make sense of their experience.
